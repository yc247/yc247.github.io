**Improving interview preparation with an AI-powered assistant built on large language models**

Motivated by our own experiences entering the data science field, we built an AI-powered tool that dynamically generates personalized interview questions, simulates mock interviews, and provides feedback. LiA leverages large language models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is fully deployed on Google Cloud to deliver a seamless, interactive experience.

**Forecasting Rideshare Fares in Chicago Using Time Series Models**

This project explores the use of time series forecasting to predict rideshare fare prices across Chicago using historical trip data from the city’s data portal. After cleaning and aggregating over 5 million records, various models—including Prophet, SARIMA, and VAR—were applied to capture seasonal trends and improve forecasting accuracy.
